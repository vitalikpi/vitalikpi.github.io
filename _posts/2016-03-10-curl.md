summary: few recipes of using curl

---

Hi, Guys!

Not sure how relevant it is now. But I want to put a few recipes using curl in enterprise software development.

So what is cURL?
=============
curl is an open source command-line tool and library for transferring data with URL syntax, supporting DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, Gopher, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMTP, SMTPS, Telnet and TFTP. curl supports SSL certificates, HTTP POST, HTTP PUT, FTP uploading, HTTP form based upload, proxies, HTTP/2, cookies, user+password authentication (Basic, Plain, Digest, CRAM-MD5, NTLM, Negotiate and Kerberos), file transfer resume, proxy tunneling and more. [link](http://curl.haxx.se)

This make curl well suitable for debugging and testing any enterprise application endpoints. Instead of going through several steps in GUI it easier to do the same thing from the console (cmd, PowerShell).

Using with Chrome
=============

As a bonus Chrome supports curl. Right click on a request shows the context menu with "Copy as cURL (cmd)":

``` bat
curl 'http://bash.org/' --compressed
-H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, sdch'
-H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8,ru;q=0.6,uk;q=0.4'
-H 'Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1'
-H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/48.0.2564.116 Safari/537.36'
-H 'Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8'
-H 'Cache-Control: max-age=0'
-H 'Proxy-Connection: keep-alive'
```

As you may see most of the parameters are HTTP headers (-H ... ). And the request can be simplified to:
``` bat
curl 'http://bash.org/' --compressed
```

Find more info about cURL in Chrome Dev Tools [here](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/network#copying-requests-as-curl-commands)

Authentication
=============
Usualy enterprise application are using integrated security authorization. cURL perfectly solves this. Here is an exampple:
``` bat
rem with password inside:
curl "http://bigenterprise.com" --negotiate -u "username@enterprise.com:**PASSWORD**"
 
rem curl will ask to provide password:
curl "http://bigenterprise.com" --negotiate -u "vitalii.pianykh.cw@carlyle.com"
```

JSON responce
=============

Usually, we get a response in JSON format. Right? Don't tell about XML it's not fancy anymore.
cURL doesn't format response. So we need an additional tool for this. My personal choice here is [jsontool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsontool).
Take a deep breath, my old-school friends. It's a package in NPM. All you need is to run and install NodeJS and run following command:
``` bat
npm install jsontool -g
```

Now it's time to get pretty printed response in you console. Pipe all the cURL output to jsontool. Like here:
``` bat
curl "http://bigenterprise.com" -H "Accept: application/json" --compressed | json
```
